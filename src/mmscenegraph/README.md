# MM Scene Graph

MatchMove Scene Graph (MM Scene Graph or 'mmscenegraph') is for representing a 3D Scene
Graph for MatchMove solving.

Solving MatchMove cameras and objects for Visual Effects (VFX) may
require the use of a 3D transform a hierarchy, known as a DAG
(Directed Acyclic Graph). The MM Scene Graph is designed to model the
Scene Graph for MatchMove tasks and provide efficent functions for
evaluation.
