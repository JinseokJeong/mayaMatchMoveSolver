# External Archives

This directory is used to store tar/zip files for external
dependencies. The external build scripts use this directory as needed
and sometimes expect files to be added to this directory.

The following archives may be expected during building and should be
downloaded from [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/):

- Autodesk_Maya_2018_EN_Linux_64bit.tgz
- Autodesk_Maya_2019_Linux_64bit.tgz
- Autodesk_Maya_2020_ML_Linux_64bit.tgz
- Autodesk_Maya_2022_ML_Linux_64bit.tgz
