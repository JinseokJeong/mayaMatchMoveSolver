# User Interface Modules

The modules in this directory are used to create or help create
graphical user interfaces.

Unless otherwise stated, all functions assume that a
display/screen/monitor is available to the process. For example the
script is running in the `maya`(`.exe`) executable, not a standalone
Python interpreter, such as `mayapy`(`.exe`).
