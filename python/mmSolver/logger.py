    Returns a Logger object for logging events.

    If the environment variable 'MMSOLVER_DEBUG' is set to '1', and

    debug messages.

    Example usage::

        import mmSolver.logger

        LOG.info('hello world')
        LOG.warning('be careful everyone')

    :param level: Set the level for the newly created Logger object.

    :return: A Logger object.
